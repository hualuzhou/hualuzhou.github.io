Overview
======
My teaching goal is not only to introduce students to fundamental concepts but also, more importantly, to guide them in developing critical thinking skills and fostering a lifelong passion for learning. I strive to create an engaging and inclusive learning environment that encourages students to ask questions, analyze problems, and explore innovative solutions. So far, Dr. Zhou has shared her food science expertise through a variety of undergraduate and graduate courses.
