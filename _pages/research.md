<!--- Overview -->
The lab research goal is generally using food science and technologies to enhance
the food nutrition, safety, and quality.
Our ongoing projects are mainly focusing on how to effectively encapsulate, project,
and deliver bioactive agents (such as vitamins, $\beta$-carotene, and polyphenols, and
their applications in the creation of sustainable foods with desirable attributes (such as
appearances, texture profiles, and nutrition). To be successful, we will integrate the
advanced experimental techniques (such as food nanotechnologies, emulsion technologies, and
INFOGEST _in vitro_ digestion model) with powerful computing techniques (such as
data mining, molecular modeling and dynamics) for understanding their fundamental
structure-function relationships.
