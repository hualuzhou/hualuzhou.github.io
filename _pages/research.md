Overview
======

Our research interest is generally using advanced food science and technologies
to create future foods and biomaterials. To be successful,
we will use or develop a variety of food and chemistry techniques to
understand their potential fundamentals, design, and applications,
including the experimental techniques (such as food nanotechnologies,
emulsion technologies, and INFOGEST _in vitro_ digestion model) and
computing techniques (such as quantum chemistry, molecular modeling
and dynamics, and data analysis). We are also expecting many potential
collaborations with other research groups and companies, and together
advance the development of next-generation food systems.
The ongoing projects are mainly focusing on 1) how to effectively
encapsulate, protect, and deliver bioactive agents, and
2) revealing physicochemical fundamentals in creating sustainable
foods and biomaterials with desirable attributes.
