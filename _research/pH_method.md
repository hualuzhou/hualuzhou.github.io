**Introduction**

The pH-based processing strategy is a straightforward yet effective approach 
for inducing structural changes in plant-derived components. 
By altering their structural arrangement, this method can significantly modify 
their physicochemical properties, enhancing their functionality in various applications.
Conventionally, few studies were focused on the investigation on how the pH-based process
alters the structures of plant-derived components.

+ **pH-induced structural changes**

The structural properties of bioactive compounds play a crucial role in determining 
their solubility, stability, and encapsulation efficiency in food systems. 
For example, curcumin is typically present in a crystalline form that limits its solubility 
and bioavailability in aqueous environments. 
Recently, we observed that the a pH-based process (alkali-acid treatment) can significantly
induce the structural changes of crystalline curcumin (**Figure 1**). 
Remarkably, curcumin aggregates formed through pH treatment can be efficiently encapsulated 
into emulsions, even at high concentrations (1 mg/mL). Microscopy analysis revealed that
the pH-induced process disrupts curcumin's crystalline structure, transitioning it
into a more dispersible form.

hydrophobic curcumin crystals into emulsion systems (such as nanoemulsions).

Our molecular dynamics simulations 
highlighted the pH-induced structural changes. 
For instance, a significant portion of the hydrophobic domain revealed that 
curcumin molecules were predominantly stabilized through hydrophobic interactions in water, 
with minimal hydrogen bond formation within curcumin molecules. 
Instead, the curcumin molecules at interface favor the hydrogen bonds with water molecules.
Therefore, our simulation results support that this alkali-acid pretreatment
significantly alters the structure and interactions of the crystalline curcumin.

+ **Formulation of phenolic compound-loaded nanoparticles from raw plants**

We hypothesize that the structure of other plant-derived components, such as proteins and 
acidic polysaccharides, can also undergo significant alterations through this approach. 
For instance, our research has demonstrated that a similar process can be employed to directly 
formulate phenolic compound-loaded nanoparticles from raw plant materials.

+ **Upcycling polyphenols from plant byproducts into foods**

Our research utilized this pH-based process for upcycling polyphenols from plant byproducts, transforming 
waste materials such as fruit peels and seeds into valuable functional food ingredients. 
For example, we have use the pH-based process to upcycle the polyphenols from peanut skin into 
the nanoemulsions as a model food system, which suggests that this processing strategy can
effectively maximize the utilization of polyphenols from plant byproducts.
