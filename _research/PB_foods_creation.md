**Introduction**

The creation of plant-based food alternatives has gained significant attention due to 
the growing need for sustainable and health-conscious dietary options. 
Traditional animal-based food production is a major contributor to environmental challenges, 
including greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water scarcity. 
At the same time, increasing awareness of the health risks associated with high 
consumption of animal products, such as cardiovascular diseases and obesity, 
has driven consumers toward plant-based diets. 
Plant-based food alternatives offer a more sustainable solution in this context.

+ **Meat alternative via a coacervation-shearing-gelling method**

High-energy processing equipment, such as extruders or shear cells, is typically 
required to produce fibrous plant-based meat analogs with textures and mouthfeels 
that mimic real meat. I proposed a low-energy alternative using a soft matter physics 
approach that combines complex coacervation, shearing, and gelation of 
protein/polysaccharide mixtures (**Figure 1**). Specifically, a mixture of potato 
protein and polysaccharide (e.g., gellan gum) was used to create chicken analogs. 
Microstructural and visual analyses revealed aligned fibrous structures resembling 
those found in real chicken. These findings demonstrate the potential of soft matter 
physics approaches to create fibrous structures and advance the development of 
plant-based meat analogs.

+ **Egg alternative via emulsion technology**

I developed a plant-based egg analog using emulsion technology, 
focusing on RuBisCO proteins extracted from plants (**Figure 2**). RuBisCO, a functional plant-based protein, 
was used to mimic the structural and functional properties of egg proteins, 
offering a sustainable and allergen-friendly alternative. 
Emulsion technology was employed to achieve the desired texture, structure, and mouthfeel characteristic of whole eggs. 
Additionally, the appearance and functionality of the egg analog were further enhanced through pH-driven technology, 
which incorporated the curcumin to achieve an improved color and consistency. Besides, we also incorporated the lutein
into the emulsions to mimic the appearance of real egg.
These advancements enable the creation of plant-based eggs with high consumer acceptability and nutritional benefits,
contributing to the development of sustainable and functional food systems.

+ **Adipose tissue alternative via emulsion technology**

I collaborated on a study to develop plant-based adipose tissue analogs using emulsion technology.
This work focused on formulating high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) based on soy proteins 
to mimic the texture, structure, and functionality of animal adipose tissue. 
The study demonstrated the potential of HIPEs to serve as sustainable and health-conscious alternatives
to animal-derived adipose tissue in plant-based meat products.
