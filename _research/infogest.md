the gastrointestinal fate and nutrition of foods and their components (2017-Now)"
---

<!-- main body -->
------------------

**Introduction**

Understanding the gastrointestinal fate of food components is crucial for evaluating their 
nutritional value and health benefits. My research focuses on using a rapid in vitro INFOGEST digestion 
model to simulate the dynamic conditions of the human gastrointestinal tract, allowing detailed analysis 
of how food components behave during digestion. This approach enables the assessment of the gastrointestinal 
stability, bioavailability, and absorption of nutrients, such as lipids and bioactive compounds. 
By integrating advanced analytical techniques such as chromatography and mass spectrometry with 
computational simulations like molecular dynamics, my work will provide valuable insights into 
the interactions between food components and digestive enzymes, as well as their gastrointestinal 
absorption and associated health effects. This research not only enhances our understanding of 
food digestion but also facilitates the development of functional foods optimized for improved 
nutritional efficacy and health outcomes.

**Gastrointestinal fate of bioactive compounds in foods**

Dr. Zhou, the Principal Investigator, began working with the in vitro digestion model 
in 2018 during her Ph.D. studies in 
[Dr. McClements' lab](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-julian-mcclements-26373110/).
Her doctoral research focused on investigating the gastrointestinal fate 
of lipids and bioactive compounds, as well as understanding how food nanoparticles influence their digestion. 
Building on this foundation, our lab continues to refine and develop a rapid in vitro digestion model to
study digestion behavior across a variety of foods, enhancing our 
ability to evaluate their nutritional properties and bioavailability.

We studied the gastrointestinal stability and bioavailability of various bioactive compounds, 
including polyphenols (e.g., curcumin, resveratrol, and quercetin), vitamins, 
and nutraceuticals (e.g., lutein, β-carotene).

+ **Polyphenols**

We demonstrated that encapsulating hydrophobic polyphenols in plant-based nanoemulsions
significantly enhanced the bioaccessibility of hydrophobic polyphenols, 
with the type of carrier oil playing a pivotal role in solubilizing these compounds into mixed micelles during digestion. 
Using curcumin, resveratrol, and quercetin as model compounds, we observed that the gastrointestinal stability 
and bioaccessibility of these polyphenols were directly influenced by their partitioning behavior 
between the oil and water phases in emulsions (Zhou et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021). 
Nanoemulsions formulated with oils that efficiently release lipids during digestion promoted better incorporation 
of the polyphenols into mixed micelles, potentially enhancing their transport across the intestinal epithelium. 
These findings highlight the importance of optimizing carrier oil selection in designing emulsified 
delivery systems to maximize the bioavailability of lipophilic polyphenols.

+ **Vitamins**

For fat-soluble vitamins, our investigations revealed that the type and size of lipid droplets in plant-based emulsions 
also influence the bioaccessibility of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, and E, with smaller droplet sizes improving 
the solubilization and transport of these vitamins during digestion (Tan et al., 2021). 
Additionally, the use of stabilizers such as nanochitin in Pickering emulsions modified the digestive process 
by reducing lipid digestion rates, which subsequently impacted the bioaccessibility of vitamin D 
and other fat-soluble nutrients (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021).

+ **Lutein and β-carotene**

Our research focuses on enhancing the bioaccessibility of lipophilic nutraceuticals like lutein and β-carotene. 
We demonstrated that lutein-fortified plant-based egg analogs significantly improved lutein bioaccessibility 
during digestion (Vu et al., 2023). Nanoemulsions optimized for lipid digestion were shown to be highly effective 
in delivering lutein compared to dietary supplements (Dai et al., 2021). Additionally, oil droplet concentration 
was identified as a key factor influencing β-carotene bioaccessibility in standardized digestion models (Tan et al., 2020). 
These findings emphasize the importance of tailored delivery systems for maximizing the absorption of lipophilic nutraceuticals.

+ **Calcium**

We demonstrated that fortifying plant-based milk with calcium reduced vitamin D bioaccessibility, 
highlighting the complex interactions between minerals and fat-soluble vitamins during digestion (Zhou et al., 2021). 
Additionally, we showed that calcium levels significantly influenced lipid digestion and the bioaccessibility 
of nutraceuticals in nanoemulsion delivery systems, emphasizing the need for optimized formulations to 
balance mineral fortification and nutrient absorption (Tan et al., 2020).
