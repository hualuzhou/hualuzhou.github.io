**Introduction**

Many bioactive compounds (such as vitamins, $\beta$-carotene, and polyphenols)
are beneficial to us, regarded as antioxidants, and used to clean free radicals.
However, they normally have low bioavailability, because of their poor solubility, crystallization, and chemical stability,
which leads to a large space to be improved for the development of bioactives-based functional foods.
There is still a need to increase their loading/encapsulating efficiency, gastrointestinal stability, and bioavailability.

At present, using advanced nanocarriers is regarded as an effective way to increase their oral bioavailability.
It has many benefits to use nanocarriers to deliver lipophilic bioactives (LBs). First, these bioactives can be dissolved and
encapsualted into the hydrophobic phase of nanocarrier, which can significantly increase the water-solubility of LBs and avoid
the potential crystallizations. Besides, the nanocarriers are kinetically stable, and thus increase the stability of LBs in solutions.
The nanoemulsion is one of common food-grade nanocarriers, where the emulsifiers can
reduce the interfacial free energy of O/W phases. It has been reported that it effectively increases the water-solubility, gastrointestinal stability and adsorption of LBs. A structural design approach to optimize these delivery systems, where
we can optimize different oil phases, emulsifier types, and structural properties of emulsions, by maximizing their
encapsulating and delivery efficiency.

+ **Optimization of delivery systems**

Many factors could be expected to impact the oral bioavailability of the LBs in the delivery systems, including
1) _emulsifier type_: some emulsifiers could be altered by the pH and tend to aggregate. They could be also
digested by the digestive enzymes, for example, nanochitin and nanocellulose.
It means that the lipids trapped in these aggregates could be hardly digested
into the mixed micelles, and thus decreases the oral bioavailability of LBs.
2) _lipid type_: the large LB could be hardly solubilized in the short, even median-chain lipids. For example, the long-chain
$\beta$-carotene cannot be effectively solubilized in the coconut oil, which usually needs a long-chain lipids, such as some vegetable oils.
3) _droplet size_: digesting the large size of droplets takes longer time and enzymes, so they could not be digested completely, while
the small size of droplets can be digested within a short time, and most of them can be formed to mixed micelles used to solubilize the
LBs.
