**Introduction**

Inorganic or organic nanoparticles are often incorporated into foods to enhance
their stability, nutrition, and quality. However, when they pass through the
gastrointestinal environment, the properties of these nanoparticles can be altered,
which impacts their biological effects and potential toxicity. Consequently,
we systematically investigated how different kinds of nanoparticles behave within
the gastrointestinal tract. We found that the gastrointestinal fate of nanoparticles
in foods depends on their unique characteristics, as well as food matrix effects.
For example, nanoparticles interact with many different components in foods and the gut,
which leads to changes in their composition, structural organization, and behavior.
These interactions could lead to alterations in the aggregation state, surface chemistry,
and digestibility of ingested nanoparticles. It is therefore essential to reveal physicochemical and molecular
mechanisms of how food-grade nanoparticles affect the lipid digestibility and nutraceutical
bioaccessibility.

**Main findings**

In this project, Hualu, as a Ph.D. student supervised by
[Professor David Julian McClements at University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.foodsci.umass.edu/faculty/d-julian-mcclements),
fabricated or characterized food-grade nanoparticles (nanoemulsions, nanocellulose, nanochitin,
titanium dioxide, etc.), and comprehensively investigated their alterations in physicochemical and structural properties
as they passed through a simulated _in vitro_ gastrointestinal tract (GIT), (_e.g._, [INFOGEST](https://www.cost-infogest.eu/)).
First, the behavior of food-grade titanium dioxide (TiO2)nanoparticles under simulated oral conditions were characterized [2].
Second, two nature-derived organic nanoparticles, anionic nanocellulose and cationic nanochitin, were fabricated [3,4].
These nanoparticles can stabilize lipid droplets and form Pickering emulsions. The impact emulsifier type (molecular versus particle)
on the gastrointestinal fate of vitamin D3-fortified emulsions was examined by measuring their physicochemical properties,
microstructure, digestibility, and bioaccessibility using an in vitro GIT model [5].
Third, the impact of nanochitin on the gastrointestinal fate of a model emulsion was examined.
The addition of nanochitin to the emulsions reduced lipid digestion and β-carotene bioaccessibility [6].
Fourth, nanocellulose, lipid nanoparticles, and TiO2 particles were added to plant-based milks
as examples of functional organic and inorganic nanoparticles. The various kinds of nanoparticles were well
dispersed in simulated gastrointestinal fluids, which was attributed to protein adsorption to
their surfaces and the mechanical action of the GIT fluids [2,7].
Fifth, it was found that calcium affected the digestion and bioaccessibility of vitamin-loaded
lipid nanoparticles in plant-based milks using an in vitro gastrointestinal model.
High levels of calcium (soluble or insoluble forms) reduced the bioaccessibility of vitamin D,
which was attributed to the formation of insoluble calcium soaps in the small intestine [7].
Overall, these results are useful for understanding the impact of different kinds of nanoparticles
on the behavior of foods within the gastrointestinal tract, which has been also summarized in a recent review article [8].
This information can help assess the potential functionality and toxicity of ingested nanoparticles.
These findings are useful for the development of functional foods,
such as fortified plant-based milks with improved physicochemical and bioaccessibility properties.
