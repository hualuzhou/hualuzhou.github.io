**Introduction**

We proposed standardized testing protocols to characterize important physicochemical
attributes of beef burgers and their plant-based (PB) analogues, including appearance,
cooking loss, water holding capacity, and textural profile, which can be used to
quantify the changes in the quality attributes
of plant-based meat analogues when they are cooked and to establish the similarities
and differences of their physicochemical attributes to real meat products.
The protocols are relatively
simple to perform and provide quantitative data for the assessment.
Their efficacy was established by measuring and comparing the physicochemical
properties of 10 commercial real and PB beef burgers. A principal component analysis
model showed appreciable differences in the cooking loss and texture profile
properties, indicating that further research is still required to create high-quality PB meat products.
