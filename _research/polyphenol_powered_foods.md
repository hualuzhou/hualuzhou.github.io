**Introduction**

Polyphenols, natural compounds found in plants, are well-known for their antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties, as well as their potential to reduce 
the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, cancer, 
and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite these health benefits, incorporating polyphenols 
into food systems remains challenging due to their poor stability, low water solubility, 
and limited bioavailability during digestion. To address these limitations, we propose a 
simple pH-based method that leverages the increased solubility of polyphenols in alkaline 
conditions due to deprotonation (**Figure 1**). This approach enables efficient extraction and encapsulation 
of polyphenols from plants or byproducts, contributing to 
the development of more nutritious and functional foods.

+ **Polyphenol-fortified plant-based emulsions & milks**

Using pH-driven methods, we successfully fortified nanoemulsions with multiple polyphenols, 
demonstrating improved encapsulation efficiency and gastrointestinal stability (Zhou et al., 2024). 
Additionally, we co-encapsulated polyphenols in plant-based milks, showing that 
these formulations protected the polyphenols during digestion and improved their 
bioaccessibility (Zheng & Zhou et al., 2023). Further studies revealed that 
curcumin-loaded plant-based milk analogs, including almond, cashew, coconut, 
and oat milks, varied in bioaccessibility depending on the milk type and lipid 
composition, emphasizing the importance of formulation optimization (Zheng & Zhou et al., 2021).

+ **Health-promoting plant-based milks by integrating polyphenols from plants**

Conventionally, the extration and encapsulation of polyphenols are separated. In this context,
we developed a “two-in-one” processing strategy, combining extraction and encapsulation, 
to incorporate curcumin from turmeric into soymilk, 
to enhance its production sustainability and affordability. 
It achieved enhanced processing sustainability and efficiency (**Figure 2**).

extracted from raw turmeric material and then encapsulated into soymilk.

+ **Peanut skin-powered foods**

The polyphenols from plant byproducts, such as peanut skins, have been 
upcycled for the development of polyphenol-powered milk alternatives via 
a simple and effective post pH-driven (PPD) method (**Figure 3**). 
The PPD method outperformed the conventional water-based approach, 
achieving 1.8 times higher retention of total polyphenolic content. 
As a result, the enhanced food antioxidant properties have been observed, 
with DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities increasing by 3.7 and 2.8 times, respectively.
