**Introduction**

Many inorganic nanoparticles (INPs) have recently been synthesized and used in the
biological research area. It has showed that they likely induce the
the autophagic effects and thus lead to a dysfunction of our cellular system, due to
their unique physicochemical properties. However, it is still unclear whether these properties
(such as size, morphology, surface modification and dispersity) can significantly induce the autophagic effects.

**Main findings**

In this project, Hualu, as a master graduate student supervised by
[Professor Jinhao Gao at Xiamen University](https://jhgao.xmu.edu.cn/index.html),
synthesized gold, iron oxide, and silica oxide nanoparticles with controllable properties, and
generally found that inorganic nanoparticles could modulate autophagic effect by their unique properties,
particularly including their dispersity, shape, and size [1].

+ **Shape**

We synthesized the gold nanoparticles with different shapes, and
compared their cellular interactions, uptakes, and autophagic effects.
The results revealed that gold nanoparticles could modulate autophagy in a shape-dependent manner.
Western blot assays and confocal images confirmed that nanospheres caused more autophagosome accumulation than nanorods,
which were highly correlated with the difference in cellular uptakes.

+ **Size**

We also showed that silica sub-microspheres (0.1 to 2.1 μm in diameter) induced autophagy,
which depended on the levels of cellular endocytosis.
Due to the suitable size for cellular endocytosis, 0.5–0.7 μm silica particles induced
the highest levels of autophagy among particles from 0.1 to 2.1 μm in diameter.
Changes in cellular endocytosis of silica sub-microspheres lead to alteration of
autophagy levels. Furthermore, dephosphorylation of FOXO3A and subsequent translocation
to the nucleus could be associated with this autophagy process. Our results revealed
that silica sub-microspheres induced autophagy, and emphasized the potential risk of
endocytosis of fine particles or other non-degradable materials.

+ **Dispersity**

We selected gold nanoparticles as an example and investigated the role of dispersity in
the autophagic effect and a potential cytotoxicity. Our results indicated that
the cytotoxicity of aggregated gold nanoparticles is significantly higher than well-dispersed ones.
The dispersity-dependent cytotoxicity could be related to the increase of
cellular endocytosis and reactive oxygen species.
