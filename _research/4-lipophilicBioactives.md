title: "Increasing the loading/encapsulating efficiency,
gastrointestinal stability, and oral bioavailability of lipophilic bioactives"
excerpt: "
**Background**: Many beneficial lipophilic bioactives (such as vitamins and polyphenols) have low bioavailability,
because of their poor solubility and chemical stability within the human gut.
Although using advanced nanocarriers (_e.g._, nanoemulsions) can improve their solubility and stability,
there is still a need on how we can effectively encapsulate, protect, and deliver them orally.
<br/>
**Funding**: This project is currently a main ongoing project, and we are expecting it has more funding supports in the future.

**Introduction**

Many lipophilic bioactives (such as vitamins, $\beta$-carotene, and polyphenols)
are beneficial to us, regarded as antioxidants, and used to clean free radicals.
However, they normally have low bioavailability, because of their poor solubility, crystallization, and chemical stability,
which leads to a large space to be improved for the development of bioactives-based functional foods.
There is still a need to increase their loading/encapsulating efficiency, gastrointestianl stability, and bioaccessibility.

At present, using advanced nanocarriers is regarded as an effective way to increase their oral bioavailability.
It has many benefits to use nanocarriers to deliver lipophilic bioactives (LBs). First, these bioactives can be dissolved and
encapsualted into the hydrophobic phase of nanocarrier, which can significantly increase the water-solubility of LBs and avoid
the potential crystallizations. Besides, the nanocarriers are kinetically stable, and thus increase the stability of LBs in solutions.
The nanoemulsion is one of common food-grade nanocarriers, where the emulsifiers can
reduce the interfacial free energy of O/W phases. It has been reported that it effectively increases the water-solubility, gastrointestinal
stability and adsorption of LBs. A structual design approach to optimize these delivery systems, where
we can optimize different oil phases, emulsifier types, and strtuctual properties of emulsions, by maximazing their
encapsulating and delivery efficiency.

Additionally, we are also intesting in how the human gastrointestianl environment can bring significant effects on their delivery and absorptions,
in particularly the potential effects of pH, salts, digestive enzymes, and the ways to be absorbed within gastrointestinal tract.

**Main findings**

+ **Optimizing delivery systems**

Many factors could be expected to impact the oral bioavailability of the LBs in the delivery systems, including
1) _emulsifier type_: some emulsifiers could be altered by the pH and tend to aggregate. They could be also
digested by the digestive enzymes, for example, nanochitin and nanocellulose.
It means that the lipids trapped in these aggreates could be hardly digested
into the mixed micelles, and thus decreases the oral bioavailability of LBs.
2) _lipid type_: the large LB could be hardly solublized in the short, even median-chain lipids. For example, the long-chain
$\beta$-carotene cannot be effectively solublized in the coconut oil, which usually needs a long-chain lipids, such as some vegtable oils.
3) _droplet size_: digesting the large size of droplets takes longer time and enzymes, so they could not be digested completely, while
the samll size of droplets can be digested within a short time, and most of them can be formed to mixed micelles used to solubilize the
LBs.
4) _physicochemical properties of LBs_: some LBs (such as polyphenols) could form non-covalent interactions with the digestive enzymes,
which could slow down the process of lipid digestion. Recently, we have found that the LogP value of lipophilic polyphenol is an important
factor to affect their gastrointestinal stability. A smaller LogP value means more hydrophilic, which means that most of polyphenols could
be disolved in the water phase, and they could be easily degraded or aggreated.

This project is still in the progress, and we will present more findings once they are published.
