ðŸŒ± Exciting News! Our New Paper is Out! ðŸŽ‰
Thrilled to share my lab's latest work: "Harnessing pH for sustainable and effective synthesis of phenolic compound-loaded nanoparticles directly from raw plants," published in Food Chemistry Elsevier!

We developed a pH-based "raw-to-nano" strategy to create phenolic compound-loaded nanoparticles directly from raw plants like turmeric, ginger, paprika, and thyme. 

This approach is:
+ âœ… Sustainable
+ âœ… Efficient
+ âœ… Cost-effective
