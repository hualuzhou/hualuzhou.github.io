So proud of my graduate student, Anthony Suryamiharja, for being selected as a finalist and winning the runner-up prize at The University of Georgia Graduate School’s Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition! 🎉 

His presentation, “Development of Protein-Rich Plant-Based Milk Through a pH-Based Approach,” showcased all the hard work and innovation he’s been doing in our lab at UGA Food Science and Technology and UGA College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. 

It’s been amazing to watch his growth and see his dedication shine through. Congratulations, Anthony—this is so well-deserved! 👏👏
