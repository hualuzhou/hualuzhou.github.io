Lu gave two presentations: "Are Plant-based Alternative Foods a Healthier Choice?" 
and "Gastrointestinal Digestion of Plant-based Foods." 
This was an amazing opportunity to share and summarize her recent three years of work 
on the plant-based food gastrointestinal digestion and bioavailability, 
which she started during my Ph.D. and postdoc at UMass Amherst.
