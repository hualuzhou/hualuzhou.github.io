Our recent work on the creation of the plant-based
adipose tissue analogs using an emulsion technology has been published in the
Food Structure. This work was mainly carried out by the Xiaoyan, and Lu also helped her
to make up additional experiments. Congratulations to Lu and her collaborators.

This paper proposed to use the high internal phase emulsions assembled from soybean oil
and soybean protein. We compared the microstructure and appearance of plant-based
adipose tissue with the real beef adipose, which showed that they still had a big difference.
However, the design may be useful for the development of plant-based meat or fish analogs.
