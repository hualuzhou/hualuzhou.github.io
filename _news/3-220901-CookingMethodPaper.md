This work investigated the impact of different cooking procedures
(pan frying, air frying, and oven baking) on the physicochemical
properties of beef and plant-based patties, in particularly the
influence of cooking temperature and time on the
appearance, texture, cooking loss, and shrinkage.

This work has been published in the _Journal of Agriculture and Food Research_.
Giang, as a undergrad, made a huge contribution to this paper, including the conception of this project,
performing experiments, and writing up the first draft, etc. Lu and Julain also provided
valuable guideness on the production of this work. Congraduations to them again.
