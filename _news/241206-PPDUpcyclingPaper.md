We developed an improved post-pH-driven (PPD) method to encapsulate pH-sensitive quercetin into nanoemulsions with an encapsulation efficiency exceeding 95%! This method is broadly applicable for incorporating various polyphenols and has been successfully applied to upcycle peanut skin polyphenols into nanoemulsions as a food model. üå±

PPD method showcases a versatile and efficient pathway to develop polyphenol-powered foods while promoting sustainability by utilizing plant byproducts. üåç Huge thanks to Dr. Xiping Gong, Minghe Wang, and Dr. Peng Lu for their contributions!
