Excited to share our new paper published in Food Frontiers: "Enhancing the Efficiency and Sustainability of Producing Curcumin-Infused Plant-Based Milk Alternatives With a Two-in-One Post pH-Driven Processing Strategy."ðŸŒ±ðŸ¥›

In this work, we developed a green, two-in-one post pH-driven processing strategy to extract curcumin directly from raw turmeric and encapsulate it into plant-based milk alternatives in a single step. By using raw turmeric instead of purified curcumin, we significantly improved the sustainability of raw material use and achieved high processing efficiency of ~96.4%!

Thanks to my student Anthony Suryamiharja and collaborators Dr. Casimir Akoh and Dr. Xiping Gong for making this paper possible! Also, big thanks to the UGA College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences CAES news team for featuring our work.

This is also the first research article from my student Anthony Suryamiharja, and I am so pround of his hard-working and contributions.
