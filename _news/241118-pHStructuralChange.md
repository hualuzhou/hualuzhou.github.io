Excited to share a recent paper from my lab, “pH-Induced Structural Changes of Crystalline Curcumin Enhance Its Encapsulation in Emulsions.” 
Several important points have been introduced in this study: 
+ We introduced an alkali-acid process to treat the curcumin crystals, enabling the rapid encapsulation in emulsions; 
+ This rapid encapsulation in emulsions is due to the pH-induced structural changes, which is dominated by the hydrophobic interactions, rather than the hydrogen bonding interactions present in crystals; and 
+ We observed that the curcumin molecules can be distributed inside the lipid phase of emulsions. 

A huge thank you to my collaborator Xiping Gong and my student Anthony Suryamiharja for their amazing contributions! 👏 👏 👏

This is his first research paper mainly contributed by Xiping and published in the ACS Food Science & Technology.
