The laboratory on the Griffin campus at the University of Georgia has recently completed a comprehensive renovation and is actively seeking new team members. Established a year ago, we are proud to feature cutting-edge technology and a collaborative environment that encourages innovation among our team and partners. We are looking for self-driven individuals eager to explore and drive forward the production of future foods and biomaterials. Join us in shaping the future.
