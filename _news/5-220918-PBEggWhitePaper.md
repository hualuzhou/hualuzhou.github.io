This work used the RuBisCO protein as the plant protein ingredient for the development of plant-based egg white
analogs. They formulated this new plant-based egg white analogs, and also compared their appearance, rheology,
and thermal gelation with the real egg white. They found that the viscosity, gelling temperature, and gel
strength of the analogs were similar as those of real egg white.

This work has been published in the _Food Chemistry_.
Lu spent a lot of time getting involved in the plant protein area. She creatively used the RuBisCO protein as
a plant protein for the development of plant-based egg white analogs. Giang also actively involved in the
experiments and discussion of this work. Lu and Giang also really thanked the Dr. McClements for his
helpful guideness, and the _Plantible Foods_ for providing the raw RuBisCO protein.
