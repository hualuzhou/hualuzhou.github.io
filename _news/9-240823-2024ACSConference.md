It is a key task for Dr. Hualu Zhou’s lab to utilize efficient technology to develop sustainable and nutritious plant-based foods. 
For example, her lab employed a simple pH-based method to develop health-promoting Golden Soy Milk. 
This method relies on a straightforward acid-base reaction but allows us to effectively infuse curcumin, the active compound in turmeric, into soy milk.

She and her student (Anthony) are thrilled that their research has gained recognition, with features in both UGA and ACS News. 
This acknowledgment highlights the impact and innovation of this work in advancing the plant-based milk.

Her lab remains committed to developing sustainable and nutritious plant-based foods, including plant-based milks, 
as part of our broader mission to promote healthier and more eco-friendly food options.
