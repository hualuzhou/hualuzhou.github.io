Our lab is currently utilizing a pH-based method to develop polyphenol-enriched plant-based milks. 
This method, while simple, has demonstrated high processing efficiency and strong environmental sustainability. 
During our participation in the ACS Fall 2024 Conference, our lab members presented three recent studies in this area.

Lu delivered an oral presentation titled, "Post pH-Driven Green Technology for Developing Polyphenol-Powered Plant-Based Foods." 
In this talk, Lu introduced the fundamental principles of a post pH-driven technology, an enhanced version of the pH-based method. 
This improved process significantly boosts both processing efficiency and environmental sustainability.

Xiping also gave an oral presentation titled, "Green pH-Based Approach for Solubilizing Curcumin Molecules into Delivery Systems." 
Xiping presented an optimized pH-based approach for treating curcumin crystals and incorporating them directly into delivery systems. 
This was Xipingâ€™s first oral presentation, marking an important milestone in his research career.

Anthony contributed a poster presentation titled, "Utilizing a Green pH-Driven Approach for Developing Curcumin-Infused Soymilk." 
Anthony showcased his exceptional work in developing curcumin-infused soymilk using the post pH-driven method, emphasizing both innovation and sustainability in food technology.
