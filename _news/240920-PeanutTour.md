I'm excited to share my experience at the 36th Annual Georgia Peanut Tour, held September 17-19, 2024, in Americus and the surrounding area. Thanks to my dear colleague Kevin E. Mis Solval for the invitation! It was an honor to co-host the opening hot topics session and present on "Innovative Processing for Peanut Skin-Powered Plant-Based Milks." ü•ú 

We had 6 great talks in total, and I'm incredibly grateful to Christopher Kucha, PhD. , Dr. Shyamalrau Tallury, Dr. David Bertioli, Dr. Jake Fountain, and Dr. Scott Monfort for their excellent presentations! üëè 

This tour provided a unique chance to explore the peanut production process up close. Alongside my student Minghe Wang and technician Bobby Goss, we visited fields, farms, and factories, witnessing the stages of planting and harvesting firsthand. It's amazing to observe the meticulous multi-step harvesting process demonstrated by skilled farmers and learn the best time to dig the peanuts! üòÄ 

A special thanks to the Georgia Peanut Commission for organizing this invaluable event! The Georgia Peanut Tour continues to be a fantastic experience for industry professionals, researchers, and enthusiasts alike. I'm grateful for the knowledge shared and connections made during this insightful event.
